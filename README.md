[Homepage](https://josephmckinsey.github.io/lean-graycode/).

Formalization of [Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code).

* Lots of bitwise lemmas about `^^^` and power of twos in $\mathbb{N}$.
* Definitions and theorems for Gray code sequences.

## Not formalized

* Linear algebraic characterization via $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vector spaces and XOR homomorphisms.
